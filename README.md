# convert-bible-numbering-systems
Convert between Russian and English Bible verse numbering systems

# purpose
Sometimes Bible translations use different verse numbering systems, especially translations in different languages. This repo lists all verses that have differing numbering between the English Standard Version (ESV) and the Russian Synodal Bible (RST).

# format
The csv file has one line for each verse that has a different numbering. All other verses that are not listed have the same numbering in both the ESV and RST.
